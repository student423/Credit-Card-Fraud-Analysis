# Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard

### **Project Overview**
This project is a comprehensive fraud analysis and detection dashboard built using **Python** for machine learning 
and **Power BI** for visualization. The goal was to build a data-driven solution that provides both a high-level business 
summary and a technical deep-dive into the model's performance.

### **Problem Statement**
The dataset contains online credit card transactions, many of which are fraudulent. 
This project aims to analyze the data to understand the problem and build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions.

### **Data Source**
- The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains transaction data from a financial company.

### **Technical Skills**
- **Python:** For data cleaning, feature engineering, and building machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- **Power BI:** For data visualization, dashboard design, and interactive reporting.
- **Git/GitHub:** For version control and project sharing.

### **Dashboard Pages**
- **Page 1: Executive Summary**
  - **KPIs:** Total Transactions, Total Amount of Fraud, Overall Fraud Rate.
  - **Donut Chart:** Visualizes the imbalanced nature of the data (fraud vs. non-fraud).
  - **Line Chart:** Shows fraud spikes over time.
- **Page 2: Technical Deep Dive**
  - **Confusion Matrix:** A visual representation of the model's accuracy.
  - **Model Comparison Chart:** Compares the performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
  - **Amount Distribution:** Analyzes the pattern of transaction amounts for fraudulent cases.

### **Key Findings**
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraudulent transactions.
- The Random Forest model showed strong performance in identifying fraudulent activity.
- A large number of fraudulent transactions occurred at specific times and were concentrated within a certain amount range.
